PM0;Number of cycles;Number of cycles performed by the float before turning itself into the Life Expiry mode (End Of Life mode). Set it to 255 if you don't plan to recover the float and you what it to cycle until exhaustion of its batteries.;CONFIG_MaxCycles_NUMBER;Applies to PROVOR and ARVOR floats, profiler configuration - Number of cycles before float turns itself off, goes into end of life mode, or into recovery mode
PM1;Cycle period;Total duration of a cycle (descent, submerged drift, ascent and transmission) (in days).;CONFIG_CycleTime_days;For APEX and ARVOR floats this is the total duration of one cycle, usually 240 hours (10 days). For SOLO floats this is the total duration of one cycle, assuming that all float operations reach their full time-out intervals before moving to the next float stage. Typically the actual cycle time will be shorter than this value.
PM2;Reference day;Float internal day number when the first ascending profile has to be made (in float day).;CONFIG_FloatReferenceDay_FloatDay;Profiler configuration - Reference day, for PROVOR and ARVOR floats this is: The day number on which the first profile is to be made. The day when the mission starts is zero.

If set to 0, no measurement is performed during the drift phase at parking depth (in hours).;CONFIG_ParkSamplingPeriod_hours;specifies sampling period during the park phase, e.g. for APEX floats could be hourly or for ARVOR floats 12 hourly, for SOLO/SOLOII floats this definition is: P,T,S is sampled during drift (park) every CONFIG_ParkSamplingPeriod_hours, e.g. every 2 hours.
PM7;Ascent sampling period;Sampling CTD period during the ascent to surface. If set to 0, no ascending profile is performed (in seconds).;CONFIG_AscentSamplingPeriod_seconds;Sampling period during the ascending profile (in seconds).

PX2;Cut-off pressure of the ascent profile;Pressure to use to separate pumped/unpumped data in the ascent profile;CONFIG_CTDPumpStopPressurePlusThreshold_dbar;The sum of CONFIG_CTDPumpStopPressure_dbar plus a pressure threshold or overlap (Poverlap). For PROVOR floats, Poverlap is defined as follows:  Poverlap = bin_size/2 for PROVOR floats with software versions < 5816A00 and ARVOR floats with software versions < 5605A00. Poverlap = 0.5 dbar for PROVOR floats with software versions >= 5816A00 and ARVOR floats with software versions >=5605A00.
PT0;Durée maxi d'activation EV en surface (utilisée pour PT8<P< PT7).;TBD;CONFIG_SurfaceValveMaxTimeAdditionalActions_csec;Maximum duration of the additional valve actions performed at the surface during the buoyancy reduction phase (in centi-seconds).
PT1;Volume transféré par l'EV maxi autorisé en profondeur (pendant les descentes et les repositionnements).;TBD;CONFIG_OilVolumeMaxPerValveAction_cm^3;This information is used as a threshold for the valve action durations. The valve flow is known for each float and CONFIG_OilVolumeMaxPerValveAction_cm^3 is converted to a maxDurationOfValveAction.  During descent phases the float regularly computes a valve duration to sink to the target depth. In some specific cases the result can be a huge valve action duration and the result must be thresholded by maxDurationOfValveAction. So yes, this information is a configuration parameter (and for Remocean float it can be modified via remote controls, but of course by specialist in PROVOR vector configuration).
PT2;Durée maxi d'activation de la pompe en profondeur durant les repositionnements.;TBD;CONFIG_PumpActionMaxTimeReposition_csec;Maximum duration of the pump action for a drift readjustment (in centi-seconds).

PT7;Pression de début de réduction de la durée d'activation EV en surface.;TBD;CONFIG_BuoyancyReductionFirstThreshold_dbar;First threshold of the buoyancy reduction phase (in dbars). From the surface to this first threshold, the float performs one initial valve action (of a computed duration) and N1 additional valve actions (of fixed durations) until the crossing of this first threshold.
PT8;Critère de pression de début de plongée.;TBD;CONFIG_BuoyancyReductionSecondThreshold_dbar;Second threshold of the buoyancy reduction phase (in dbars). From the first threshold to this second threshold, the float performs N2 additional valve actions (of computed durations) until the crossing of this second threshold. The descent to park phase starts at the crossing of this second threshold.
PT9;Nombre de positions hors tolérance autorisé en dérive avant repositionnement.;TBD;CONFIG_NumberOfOutOfTolerancePresBeforeReposition_COUNT;Number of consecutive pressure measurements outside the target pressure interval before performing a drift readjustment.
PT10;Mode de gestion de l'échouage en descente à la pression de dérive (0 = décalage, 1 = attente).;TBD;CONFIG_GroundingMode_LOGICAL;Action performed by the float when a grounding is detected. 0: the float changes its drift pressure, 1: the float stays on the seabed until the next phase of the cycle.
PT11;Critère d'échouage: volume cumulé (volume minimal transféré sans déplacement avant de déclarer l’échouage).;TBD;CONFIG_OilVolumeMinForGroundingDetection_cm^3;This information is a threshold used to detect a grounding of the float. If there is no vertical motion after having tranfered CONFIG_OilVolumeMinForGroundingDetection_cm^3 through the valve, the gounded flag is activated and the float acts as configurated by the CONFIG_GroundingMode_LOGICAL parameter.So, yes it is a configuration parameter (and I can easily understand that it can be modified via remote control since some PROVOR floats have experienced erroneous grounding detection (under study but perhaps due to in-situ conditions).
PT12;Pression en dessous de laquelle le flotteur reste posé en attente profil remontée (quand PT10 = 0, la pression de dérive est diminuée de PT13 uniquement si elle est supérieure à PT12).;TBD;CONFIG_GroundingModeMinPresThreshold_dbar;If in grounding mode 0, the float changes its drift pressure only if its current pressure is greater than this value.
PT13;Diminution de la pression visée en cas d'échouage (quand PT10 = 0, la pression de dérive est diminuée de PT13 uniquement si elle est supérieure à PT12).;TBD;CONFIG_GroundingModePresAdjustment_dbar;If in grounding mode 0, the float changes its drift pressure to its programmed one minus this value only if its current pressure is greater than this value.
PT14;Tolérance sur maintien de la pression de consigne (+/-).;TBD;CONFIG_PressureTargetToleranceDuringDrift_dbar;Defines the target pressure interval for float drift at parking or profile depth (in dbars).

Specifying depth zone is optional e.g. if the power acquistion mode is common to all depth zones then there is no need to specify depth zone. Input options for CTD (1 : continuous, 2 : pulsed). Input options for Optode (0: none, 1 : continuous, 2 : pulsed).
PT18;Vitesse moyenne de descente.;TBD;CONFIG_DescentSpeed_mm/s;Descent speed during downcast in mm/s (can be used to estimate the time to descent from parking pressure to profile pressure)
PT20;Pression d’arrêt de la pompe de la CTD.;TBD;CONFIG_CTDPumpStopPressure_dbar;The pressure at which the CTD pump is switched off.  As the float ascends, the code looks at the pressure and if <= CONFIG_CTDPumpStopPressure, the CTD is turned off. CTDPumpStopPressure is a firmware threshold and as such, data may continue to be collected for a limited span after the threshold is recognized. Especially in floats that return high resolution discrete data, there might be data collected shallower than the cut off, due to the discrete nature of the pressure data and also due to the time necessary for the firmware to turn off the CTD once the pressure threshold is reached. For example for SOLOII floats the CTD is switched off at 1dbar, and typically the shallowest data is from 0.5 to 0.8 dbar. This shallow data should be carefully assessed for its validity.
