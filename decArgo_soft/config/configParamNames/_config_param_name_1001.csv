CONFIG_UP;n/a;Up time [hours];CONFIG_UpTime_hours;preset duration of the 'up' time (start of ascent to start of descent) - changed from : CONFIG_UpTimeInterval_hours and CONFIG_UpTimeOut
CONFIG_DOWN;n/a;Down time [hours];CONFIG_DownTime_hours;preset duration of the down time (start of descent to start of ascent) - changed from : CONFIG_DownTimeInterval_hours and CONFIG_DownTimeOut
CONFIG_PRKP;n/a;Park pressure [centibars];CONFIG_ParkPressure_dbar;park pressure - this may change if the float is reprogrammed and must be reported in the mission configuration settings
CONFIG_PPP;n/a;Park piston position [counts];CONFIG_PistonPark_COUNT;preset park piston position, in counts   
CONFIG_NUDGE;n/a;Buoyancy nudge during ascent [counts];CONFIG_AscentAdjustmentToBuoyancy_seconds;commonly cited as 'buoyancy nudge', this controls the ascent rate, units could be COUNT or whatever is reported, i.e. for SOLOII it is seconds pump is run to adjust float rise rate on ascent.
CONFIG_OK;n/a;Internal vacuum threshold [counts];CONFIG_OkVacuum_COUNT;Internal vacuum threshold (counts).
CONFIG_ASCEND;n/a;Ascent time-out [hours];CONFIG_AscentToSurfaceTimeOut_hours;maximum time a float will try to reach its target depth (surface) before aborting this step
CONFIG_TBP;n/a;Maximum air bladder pressure [counts];CONFIG_PressureBladderMax_dbar;maximum air bladder pressure setting - units could be COUNT
CONFIG_TP;n/a;Profile pressure [centibar];CONFIG_ProfilePressure_dbar;profile pressure - this may change if the float is reprogrammed and must be reported in the mission configuration settings
CONFIG_TPP;n/a;Profile piston position [counts];CONFIG_PistonProfile_COUNT;preset profile piston position, in counts   
CONFIG_N;n/a;Park and profile cycle length;CONFIG_ParkAndProfileCycleCounter_COUNT;The number of profiles performed from Park depth before a deep profile is done.
CONFIG_FEXT;n/a;Piston full extension [counts];CONFIG_PistonFullExtension_COUNT;n/a
CONFIG_FRET;n/a;Piston full retraction [counts];CONFIG_PistonFullRetraction_COUNT;n/a
CONFIG_IBN;n/a;Initial buoyancy nudge (starts profile) [counts];CONFIG_FirstBuoyancyNudge_COUNT;test message data - initial buoyancy nudge which is used at both the beginning and end of the profile  
CONFIG_CHR;n/a;Compensator hyper-retraction [counts];CONFIG_CompensatorHyperRetraction_COUNT;setting for the compensator hyper-retraction
CONFIG_PACT;n/a;Pressure-activation piston position [counts];CONFIG_PistonPositionPressureActivation_COUNT;preset piston position for pressure activation
CONFIG_DPDP;n/a;Deep profile descent period [hours];CONFIG_DescentToProfTimeOut_hours;maximum amount of time allowed for the float to descend to Profile pressure from Park pressure
CONFIG_PDP;n/a;Park descent period [hours];CONFIG_DescentToParkTimeOut_hours;maximum time a float will try to reach its target depth (park) before aborting this step
CONFIG_PRE;n/a;Mission prelude period [hours];CONFIG_MissionPreludeTime_hours;This is the duration the float transmits test messages for (from start up) before the first dive. It’s crucial in calculating the time of the first descent.
CONFIG_REP;n/a;ARGOS transmission repetition period [seconds];CONFIG_TransmissionRepetitionPeriod_seconds;transmission repetition rate, metadata for most floats - may be variable for two-way communication
CONFIG_TOD;n/a;Minutes past midnight when down-time will expire. If ToD feature disabled, bytes = 0xfffe.;CONFIG_DownTimeExpiryTimeOfDay_minutes;a time out value (time of day, i.e. in minutes past midnight) for expiration of the down time
CONFIG_DEBUG;n/a;Debugging Verbosity for generating engineering log entries;CONFIG_LoggingVerbosity_NUMBER;Logging verbosity is an integer (values in range [0,4] for these floats) describing the parameters to be output. An integer in the range [0,4] that determines the logging verbosity with lower values producing more terse logging. A verbosity of 2 yields standard logging.
CONFIG_DIR;n/a;Misc. configuration information;CONFIG_Direction_NUMBER;Ascending = 1, Descending = 2, Ascending and Descending = 3
CONFIG_CT;n/a;Misc. configuration information;CONFIG_CycleTime_hours;For APEX and ARVOR floats this is the total duration of one cycle, usually 240 hours (10 days). For SOLO floats this is the total duration of one cycle, assuming that all float operations reach their full time-out intervals before moving to the next float stage. Typically the actual cycle time will be shorter than this value.
CONFIG_DPF;n/a;Misc. configuration information;CONFIG_DeepProfileFirstFloat_LOGICAL;"Some APEX floats are set to do a ""profile on deployment"". This means that when the float is deployed it skips the drift phase at the PARKING depth and sinks directly to the PROFILE depth and starts ascending for the first profile. Independent of the Park and Profile cycle length, the first profile is always a Deep Profile that begins at the Profile Depth. This means the float returns a CTD profile relatively soon, typically less than a day, after the float is deployed. This feature supports comparison of the initial float profile with a conventional CTD cast from the ship. The result is that the first cycle is of shorter duration with a profile depth equal to PROFILE configuration pressure (regardless of the CONFIG_ParkAndProfileCycleCounter_COUNT configuration information). (Yes = 1, No = 0)."
