204;254;Max volume eV during descent and repositionning (in cm3);CONFIG_OilVolumeMaxPerValveAction_cm^3;This information is used as a threshold for the valve action durations. The valve flow is known for each float and CONFIG_OilVolumeMaxPerValveAction_cm^3 is converted to a maxDurationOfValveAction.  During descent phases the float regularly computes a valve duration to sink to the target depth. In some specific cases the result can be a huge valve action duration and the result must be thresholded by maxDurationOfValveAction. So yes, this information is a configuration parameter (and for Remocean float it can be modified via remote controls, but of course by specialist in PROVOR vector configuration).
205;254;Max duration pump during repositioning (in csec);CONFIG_PumpActionMaxTimeReposition_csec;Maximum duration of the pump action for a drift readjustment (in centi-seconds).

214;254;Max volume before detecting grounding (in cm3);CONFIG_OilVolumeMinForGroundingDetection_cm^3;This information is a threshold used to detect a grounding of the float. If there is no vertical motion after having tranfered CONFIG_OilVolumeMinForGroundingDetection_cm^3 through the valve, the gounded flag is activated and the float acts as configurated by the CONFIG_GroundingMode_LOGICAL parameter.So, yes it is a configuration parameter (and I can easily understand that it can be modified via remote control since some PROVOR floats have experienced erroneous grounding detection (under study but perhaps due to in-situ conditions).

216;254;Grounding switch pressure (in dBars);CONFIG_GroundingModePresAdjustment_dbar;If in grounding mode 0, the float changes its drift pressure to its programmed one minus this value only if its current pressure is greater than this value.
217;254;Pressure delta during drift (in dBars);CONFIG_PressureTargetToleranceDuringDrift_dbar;Defines the target pressure interval for float drift at parking or profile depth (in dbars).
218;254;Average descent speed (in mm/sec);CONFIG_DescentSpeed_mm/s;Descent speed during downcast in mm/s (can be used to estimate the time to descent from parking pressure to profile pressure)

407;255;;CONFIG_CycleTime_hours;For APEX and ARVOR floats this is the total duration of one cycle, usually 240 hours (10 days). For SOLO floats this is the total duration of one cycle, assuming that all float operations reach their full time-out intervals before moving to the next float stage. Typically the actual cycle time will be shorter than this value.

604;251;Cut-off pressure of CTD (dbar);CONFIG_CTDPumpStopPressure_dbar;The pressure at which the CTD pump is switched off.  As the float ascends, the code looks at the pressure and if <= CONFIG_CTDPumpStopPressure, the CTD is turned off. CTDPumpStopPressure is a firmware threshold and as such, data may continue to be collected for a limited span after the threshold is recognized. Especially in floats that return high resolution discrete data, there might be data collected shallower than the cut off, due to the discrete nature of the pressure data and also due to the time necessary for the firmware to turn off the CTD once the pressure threshold is reached. For example for SOLOII floats the CTD is switched off at 1dbar, and typically the shallowest data is from 0.5 to 0.8 dbar. This shallow data should be carefully assessed for its validity.
