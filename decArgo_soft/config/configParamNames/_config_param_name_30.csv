MC0;Total Number of Cycles;Number of cycles performed by the float before turning itself into the Life Expiry mode (End Of Life mode). Set it to 255 if you don't plan to recover the float and you what it to cycle until exhaustion of its batteries.;CONFIG_MaxCycles_NUMBER;Applies to PROVOR and ARVOR floats, profiler configuration - Number of cycles before float turns itself off, goes into end of life mode, or into recovery mode
MC002;Cycle period;Total duration of a cycle (descent, submerged drift, ascent and transmission) (in days).;CONFIG_CycleTime_hours;For APEX and ARVOR floats this is the total duration of one cycle, usually 240 hours (10 days). For SOLO floats this is the total duration of one cycle, assuming that all float operations reach their full time-out intervals before moving to the next float stage. Typically the actual cycle time will be shorter than this value.

So I will use CONFIG_TelemetryRetransmission_COUNT

At lower latitudes you may wish to increase the value of this parameter to increase the probability of reception of all of your data (in hours).;CONFIG_TransmissionMinTime_hours;The time the float will remain on the surface transmitting its data at the end of each cycle. At lower latitudes you may wish to increase the value of this parameter to increase the probability of reception of all of your data.
AC6;Prelude duration;Duration of the prelude phase (in minutes).;CONFIG_MissionPreludeTime_minutes;This is the duration the float transmits test messages for (from start up) before the first dive. It’s crucial in calculating the time of the first descent.
PX0;Profiling direction;The float can perform descending profiles or ascending profiles or both.;CONFIG_Direction_NUMBER;Ascending = 1, Descending = 2, Ascending and Descending = 3
PX1;Cut-off pressure of the CTD pump;During the ascending profile, the CTD pump is switched off at a prescribed depth.;CONFIG_CTDPumpStopPressure_dbar;The pressure at which the CTD pump is switched off.  As the float ascends, the code looks at the pressure and if <= CONFIG_CTDPumpStopPressure, the CTD is turned off. CTDPumpStopPressure is a firmware threshold and as such, data may continue to be collected for a limited span after the threshold is recognized. Especially in floats that return high resolution discrete data, there might be data collected shallower than the cut off, due to the discrete nature of the pressure data and also due to the time necessary for the firmware to turn off the CTD once the pressure threshold is reached. For example for SOLOII floats the CTD is switched off at 1dbar, and typically the shallowest data is from 0.5 to 0.8 dbar. This shallow data should be carefully assessed for its validity.
PX2;Cut-off pressure of the ascent profile;Pressure to use to separate pumped/unpumped data in the ascent profile;CONFIG_CTDPumpStopPressurePlusThreshold_dbar;The sum of CONFIG_CTDPumpStopPressure_dbar plus a pressure threshold or overlap (Poverlap). For PROVOR floats, Poverlap is defined as follows:  Poverlap = bin_size/2 for PROVOR floats with software versions < 5816A00 and ARVOR floats with software versions < 5605A00. Poverlap = 0.5 dbar for PROVOR floats with software versions >= 5816A00 and ARVOR floats with software versions >=5605A00.
TC0;Durée maxi d'activation ev en surface (utilisée pour P < palier1);TBD;CONFIG_SurfaceValveMaxTimeAdditionalActions_csec;Maximum duration of the additional valve actions performed at the surface during the buoyancy reduction phase (in centi-seconds).
TC1;Volume transféré par l'ev maxi autorisé en profondeur;TBD;CONFIG_OilVolumeMaxPerValveAction_cm^3;This information is used as a threshold for the valve action durations. The valve flow is known for each float and CONFIG_OilVolumeMaxPerValveAction_cm^3 is converted to a maxDurationOfValveAction.  During descent phases the float regularly computes a valve duration to sink to the target depth. In some specific cases the result can be a huge valve action duration and the result must be thresholded by maxDurationOfValveAction. So yes, this information is a configuration parameter (and for Remocean float it can be modified via remote controls, but of course by specialist in PROVOR vector configuration).
TC2;Durée maxi d'activation pompe en profondeur;TBD;CONFIG_PumpActionMaxTimeReposition_csec;Maximum duration of the pump action for a drift readjustment (in centi-seconds).
TC3;Durée maxi d'activation pompe en remontée;TBD;CONFIG_PumpActionMaxTimeAscent_csec;Maximum duration of a pump action during ascent (in centi-seconds).
TC4;Durée nominale d'activation pompe en émergence;TBD;CONFIG_PumpActionTimeBuoyancyAcquisition_csec;Duration of the last pump action of the buoyancy acquisition phase (in centi-seconds).
TC5;Tolérance sur l'atteinte de la pression de consigne (+/-);TBD;CONFIG_PressureTargetToleranceForStabilisation_dbar;Defines the target pressure interval for float stabilisation at parking or profile depth (in dbars).

TC7;Pression de début de réduction de la durée d'activation ev en surface;TBD;CONFIG_BuoyancyReductionFirstThreshold_dbar;First threshold of the buoyancy reduction phase (in dbars). From the surface to this first threshold, the float performs one initial valve action (of a computed duration) and N1 additional valve actions (of fixed durations) until the crossing of this first threshold.
TC8;Critère de pression de début de plongée;TBD;CONFIG_BuoyancyReductionSecondThreshold_dbar;Second threshold of the buoyancy reduction phase (in dbars). From the first threshold to this second threshold, the float performs N2 additional valve actions (of computed durations) until the crossing of this second threshold. The descent to park phase starts at the crossing of this second threshold.
TC9;Nbre de positions hors tolérance autorisé en dérive conduisant à repositionnement;TBD;CONFIG_NumberOfOutOfTolerancePresBeforeReposition_COUNT;Number of consecutive pressure measurements outside the target pressure interval before performing a drift readjustment.
TC10;Critère d'échouage: volume cumulé;TBD;CONFIG_OilVolumeMinForGroundingDetection_cm^3;This information is a threshold used to detect a grounding of the float. If there is no vertical motion after having tranfered CONFIG_OilVolumeMinForGroundingDetection_cm^3 through the valve, the gounded flag is activated and the float acts as configurated by the CONFIG_GroundingMode_LOGICAL parameter.So, yes it is a configuration parameter (and I can easily understand that it can be modified via remote control since some PROVOR floats have experienced erroneous grounding detection (under study but perhaps due to in-situ conditions).
TC11;Pression en dessous de laquelle le flotteur reste posé en attente profil remontée;TBD;CONFIG_GroundingModeMinPresThreshold_dbar;If in grounding mode 0, the float changes its drift pressure only if its current pressure is greater than this value.

TC20;Pression de fin de remontée.;TBD;CONFIG_AscentEndThreshold_dbar;Threshold used by the float to stop ascent speed control and pump actions.
TC21;Vitesse moyenne de remontée.;TBD;CONFIG_AscentSpeed_mm/s;ascent speed during upcast in mm/s or cm/s (can be used to estimate the profile duration)
TC22;Période de mesure de la pression en remontée (période du contrôle de la vitesse de remontée).;TBD;CONFIG_PressureCheckTimeAscent_minutes;Period of the pressure checks during the float ascent to surface (in minutes).
TC23;Ecart de pression pour stabilisation en remontée (tous les TC22, si |DP|  < TC23 => action de pompe).;TBD;CONFIG_AscentVerticalThresholdForBuoyancyAction_dbar;If the float vertical motion, during CONFIG_PressureCheckTimeAscent_minutes, is less than this threshold, the float makes buoyancy adjustments.
