CONFIG_ASCEND;AscentTimeOut;n/a;CONFIG_AscentToSurfaceTimeOut_minutes;maximum time a float will try to reach its target depth (surface) before aborting this step
CONFIG_NUDGE;BuoyancyNudge;n/a;CONFIG_AscentAdjustmentToBuoyancy_COUNT;commonly cited as 'buoyancy nudge', this controls the ascent rate, units could be COUNT or whatever is reported, i.e. for SOLOII it is seconds pump is run to adjust float rise rate on ascent.
CONFIG_IBN;BuoyancyNudgeInitial;n/a;CONFIG_FirstBuoyancyNudge_COUNT;test message data - initial buoyancy nudge which is used at both the beginning and end of the profile  
CONFIG_CTO;ConnectTimeOut;n/a;CONFIG_ConnectionTimeOut_seconds;Connection time-out, i.e. maximum transmission period for one telemetry session
CONFIG_CPAP;CpActivationP;n/a;CONFIG_CPActivationPressure_dbar;CP Activation Pressure
CONFIG_CT;CycleTime;n/a;CONFIG_CycleTime_minutes;For APEX and ARVOR floats this is the total duration of one cycle, usually 240 hours (10 days). For SOLO floats this is the total duration of one cycle, assuming that all float operations reach their full time-out intervals before moving to the next float stage. Typically the actual cycle time will be shorter than this value.
CONFIG_DB;DebugBits;n/a;CONFIG_DebugBits_hex;Awaiting clarification. A request is in with Webb for more information
CONFIG_TPP;DeepProfileBuoyancyPos;n/a;CONFIG_PistonProfile_COUNT;preset profile piston position, in counts   
CONFIG_DPDP;DeepProfileDescentTime;n/a;CONFIG_DescentToProfTimeOut_minutes;maximum amount of time allowed for the float to descend to Profile pressure from Park pressure
CONFIG_DPF;DeepProfileFirstFloat;n/a;CONFIG_DeepProfileFirstFloat_LOGICAL;"Some APEX floats are set to do a ""profile on deployment"". This means that when the float is deployed it skips the drift phase at the PARKING depth and sinks directly to the PROFILE depth and starts ascending for the first profile. Independent of the Park and Profile cycle length, the first profile is always a Deep Profile that begins at the Profile Depth. This means the float returns a CTD profile relatively soon, typically less than a day, after the float is deployed. This feature supports comparison of the initial float profile with a conventional CTD cast from the ship. The result is that the first cycle is of shorter duration with a profile depth equal to PROFILE configuration pressure (regardless of the CONFIG_ParkAndProfileCycleCounter_COUNT configuration information). (Yes = 1, No = 0)."
CONFIG_TP;DeepProfilePressure;n/a;CONFIG_ProfilePressure_dbar;profile pressure - this may change if the float is reprogrammed and must be reported in the mission configuration settings
CONFIG_DOWN;DownTime;n/a;CONFIG_DownTime_minutes;preset duration of the down time (start of descent to start of ascent) - changed from : CONFIG_DownTimeInterval_hours and CONFIG_DownTimeOut
CONFIG_FEXT;FullExtension;n/a;CONFIG_PistonFullExtension_COUNT;TBD
CONFIG_FRET;FullRetraction;n/a;CONFIG_PistonFullRetraction_COUNT;TBD
CONFIG_HPVE;HpvEmfK;n/a;CONFIG_AUX_HpvEmfK_Volt-Sec/Radian;Contact Sea-Bird Electronics, Inc for assistance.
CONFIG_HPVR;HpvRes;n/a;CONFIG_AUX_HpvRes_Ohms;Contact Sea-Bird Electronics, Inc for assistance.
CONFIG_TBP;MaxAirBladder;n/a;CONFIG_PressureBladderMax_COUNT;maximum air bladder pressure setting - units could be COUNT
CONFIG_MLS;MaxLogKb;n/a;CONFIG_MaxSizeEngineeringLogFile_kbyte;Maximum size of engineering log file.
CONFIG_PRE;MissionPrelude;n/a;CONFIG_MissionPreludeTime_minutes;This is the duration the float transmits test messages for (from start up) before the first dive. It’s crucial in calculating the time of the first descent.
CONFIG_OIAM;OptodeInAirMeas;n/a;CONFIG_OptodeMeasurementsInAir_LOGICAL;Sensors can be mounted on a stick to perform measurements in Air. Values: Yes = 1, No = 0
CONFIG_OTPO;OptodeTimePresOffset;n/a;CONFIG_OptodeTimePressureOffset_seconds;Time interval between  optode and pressure measurements due to the fact that the optode answer is not simultaneous with the CTD/pressure answer
CONFIG_OVO;OptodeVerticalPresOffset;n/a;CONFIG_OptodeVerticalPressureOffset_dbar;vertical pressure offset due to the fact that the sensor is not exactly at the Ctd pressure
CONFIG_OK;OkVacuum;n/a;CONFIG_OkVacuum_COUNT;Internal vacuum threshold (counts).
CONFIG_PACT;PActivationBuoyancyPosition;n/a;CONFIG_PistonPositionPressureActivation_COUNT;preset piston position for pressure activation
CONFIG_PPP;ParkBuoyancyPos;n/a;CONFIG_PistonPark_COUNT;preset park piston position, in counts   
CONFIG_PDP;ParkDescentTime;n/a;CONFIG_DescentToParkTimeOut_minutes;maximum time a float will try to reach its target depth (park) before aborting this step
CONFIG_PRKP;ParkPressure;n/a;CONFIG_ParkPressure_dbar;park pressure - this may change if the float is reprogrammed and must be reported in the mission configuration settings
CONFIG_N;PnPCycleLen;n/a;CONFIG_ParkAndProfileCycleCounter_COUNT;The number of profiles performed from Park depth before a deep profile is done.
CONFIG_DIR;ProfilingDirection;n/a;CONFIG_Direction_NUMBER;Ascending = 1, Descending = 2, Ascending and Descending = 3
CONFIG_TRI;TelemetryRetry;n/a;CONFIG_TelemetryRetryInterval_minutes;Amount of time the float waits before trying to retransmit
CONFIG_TOD;TimeOfDay;n/a;CONFIG_DownTimeExpiryTimeOfDay_minutes;a time out value (time of day, i.e. in minutes past midnight) for expiration of the down time
CONFIG_UP;UpTime;n/a;CONFIG_UpTime_minutes;preset duration of the 'up' time (start of ascent to start of descent) - changed from : CONFIG_UpTimeInterval_hours and CONFIG_UpTimeOut
CONFIG_DEBUG;Verbosity;n/a;CONFIG_LoggingVerbosity_NUMBER;Logging verbosity is an integer (values in range [0,4] for these floats) describing the parameters to be output. An integer in the range [0,4] that determines the logging verbosity with lower values producing more terse logging. A verbosity of 2 yields standard logging.
