PM00;Number of cycles;This is the number of cycles of descent, submerged drift, ascent and transmission that ARVOR-C will perform. The mission ends and ARVOR-C enters Life Expiry mode when this number of cycles has been completed. This number of cycle is calculated with number of date for float to be on surface that have been programmed. User can not change directly this parameter.;CONFIG_MaxCycles_NUMBER;Applies to PROVOR and ARVOR floats, profiler configuration - Number of cycles before float turns itself off, goes into end of life mode, or into recovery mode
PM01;Delay before mission;This is the delay before float begins its mission. This delay enable to prepare deployment operations.;CONFIG_DelayBeforeMissionStart_minutes;Float waiting period before the first cycle of its mission (in minutes).
PM02;EOL Iridium period;This parameters specifies period of Iridium messages transmission as float has enterd in End Of Life phase.;CONFIG_TransmissionPeriodEndOfLife_minutes;Period of the Iridium transmission when in End Of Life mode (in minutes).
