CONFIG_DIR;n/a;n/a;CONFIG_Direction_NUMBER;Ascending = 1, Descending = 2, Ascending and Descending = 3
CONFIG_CT;n/a;n/a;CONFIG_CycleTime_minutes;For APEX and ARVOR floats this is the total duration of one cycle, usually 240 hours (10 days). For SOLO floats this is the total duration of one cycle, assuming that all float operations reach their full time-out intervals before moving to the next float stage. Typically the actual cycle time will be shorter than this value.
CONFIG_ARM;n/a;Activates or deactivates Recovery mode.;CONFIG_RecoveryModeActivate_LOGICAL;Activates or deactivates recovery mode. Recovery mode is operator activated. If activated, the float remains on the surface indefinitely while transmitting its position and log files and downloading new mission and sample configuration parameters if available. If Recovery mode is then deactivated, the float will begin the Park Descent phase of a new mission.
CONFIG_AR;n/a;The rate of ascent in decibars per second that the float attempts to maintain. During the ascent the float measures its actual ascent rate, and if it is less than AscentRate, the buoyancy position is moved in accordance with BuoyancyNudge.;CONFIG_AscentSpeed_mm/s;ascent speed during upcast in mm/s or cm/s (can be used to estimate the profile duration)
CONFIG_TOD;n/a;Enables time of day operation with the entry of one to as many as four settings. One setting is required, up to three additional settings are optional. The required setting is the minutes after GMT midnight at which an ascent will start after the initial Park phase period. The three optional settings are minutes after GMT midnight at which up to three additional ascents will start on the same day. For these optional settings, the operator must ensure that there is enough time in the day for the float to descend and then ascend at each of the specified times, otherwise the time of an ascent will be extended to the following day. The operator must also take into account PnPCycleLen when estimating ascent times. A setting of -1 disables the time of day operation.;CONFIG_DownTimeExpiryTimeOfDay_minutes;a time out value (time of day, i.e. in minutes past midnight) for expiration of the down time
CONFIG_ASCEND;n/a;The amount of time in minutes allowed for the float to reach the surface. Should it not reach the surface in this period, it will stop sampling and transition to the Surface phase and fully inflate both the oil and air compartments of the bladder.;CONFIG_AscentToSurfaceTimeOut_minutes;maximum time a float will try to reach its target depth (surface) before aborting this step
CONFIG_ATI;n/a;The interval in seconds between float samples of the pressure to check the ascent rate and to determine if the surface has been reached.

CONFIG_NUDGE;n/a;The number of counts to add to the current piston position so as to incrementally increase the buoyancy of the float when its ascent rate is below that specified by AscentRate.;CONFIG_AscentAdjustmentToBuoyancy_COUNT;commonly cited as 'buoyancy nudge', this controls the ascent rate, units could be COUNT or whatever is reported, i.e. for SOLOII it is seconds pump is run to adjust float rise rate on ascent.
CONFIG_TPP;n/a;The piston position in counts that will cause the float to descend to its Profile depth. This configuration parameter is dynamically updated during each profiling cycle based on the adjustments needed to reach the desired Profile depth.;CONFIG_PistonProfile_COUNT;preset profile piston position, in counts   
CONFIG_TP;n/a;The pressure in decibars associated with the Profile depth.;CONFIG_ProfilePressure_dbar;profile pressure - this may change if the float is reprogrammed and must be reported in the mission configuration settings

Should the float not reach its Profile depth in this period, it will stop descending and transition to the Ascent phase.;CONFIG_DescentToProfTimeOut_minutes;maximum amount of time allowed for the float to descend to Profile pressure from Park pressure
CONFIG_DDTI;n/a;The interval in seconds between float samples of the pressure to determine if the Profile depth has been reached.;CONFIG_PressureCheckTimeDescentToProfileDepth_seconds;The interval in seconds between float samples of the pressure to determine if the Profile depth has been reached.
CONFIG_DPF;n/a;"If set to ""on,"" the float will, on its first descent only, after the Mission Prelude, remain in the Park phase for five minutes before descending to the Profile depth. If set to ""off,"" the first Park phase period is as described in “Park Phase” on page 3-6.";CONFIG_DeepProfileFirstFloat_LOGICAL;"Some APEX floats are set to do a ""profile on deployment"". This means that when the float is deployed it skips the drift phase at the PARKING depth and sinks directly to the PROFILE depth and starts ascending for the first profile. Independent of the Park and Profile cycle length, the first profile is always a Deep Profile that begins at the Profile Depth. This means the float returns a CTD profile relatively soon, typically less than a day, after the float is deployed. This feature supports comparison of the initial float profile with a conventional CTD cast from the ship. The result is that the first cycle is of shorter duration with a profile depth equal to PROFILE configuration pressure (regardless of the CONFIG_ParkAndProfileCycleCounter_COUNT configuration information). (Yes = 1, No = 0)."
CONFIG_DOWN;n/a;The allocated time in minutes for the float to leave the surface and to reach the Profile depth, or in cases where PnPCycleLen is greater than 1, the time to complete the Park phase.;CONFIG_DownTime_minutes;preset duration of the down time (start of descent to start of ascent) - changed from : CONFIG_DownTimeInterval_hours and CONFIG_DownTimeOut

In particular, the HyperRetractPressure is the pressure that the float uses to restore the piston back to the ParkDescentCount.;CONFIG_HyperRetractionStopPressure_dbar;For Apex APF11 Iridium floats, Hyper Retraction is used to pull in an amount of oil to temporarily increase a float’s density as it leaves the ocean surface. The result of the increased float density allows a float to move through a mixed density layer more easily or allows a float to descend at a faster rate. In particular, the HyperRetractPressure is the pressure that the float uses to restore the piston back to the ParkDescentCount.
CONFIG_IBD;n/a;The period in days over which the float avoids the surface due to the possible presence of large, crushing icebergs but performs all the other phases during each profiling cycle. The period starts with the first determination of the non-presence of ice after having determined the presence of ice over the previous missions.;CONFIG_IceDetectionSpringInhibitionDelaySinceLastIceEvasion_days;Maximum delay (in days/cycles) since the last ice evasiondate to attempt a surfacing.

CONFIG_IEP;n/a;The pressure in decibars at which the float begins processing the collected temperature data to determine the mixed layer median temperature. While processing the temperature data, the float continues to collect more data as it ascends. If the median temperature is below IceCriticalT, the ascent is halted and the float transitions to the Park Descent phase of a new mission. IceEvasionP should be at least 15 decibars less than IceDetectionP.;CONFIG_IceDetectionStartPressure_dbar;Start pressure of the ice detection algorithm.
CONFIG_ICEM;n/a;Determines the months of the year during which ice avoidance is enabled.

For more than one month, whether contiguous or not, “or” the values of all the months to determine the binary value. For example, to detect ice during the contiguous months of May to September, the binary value is 000111110000. Converting to hexadecimal, the entry is 0x01f0. For the months January to May and September to December, the binary value is 111100011111. Converting to hexadecimal, the entry is 0x0f1f.;CONFIG_BitMaskMonthsIceDetectionActive_NUMBER;When is ice detection active - months in reverse order

CONFIG_COP;n/a;Cutoff pressure of the CTD pump.;CONFIG_CTDPumpStopPressure_dbar;The pressure at which the CTD pump is switched off.  As the float ascends, the code looks at the pressure and if <= CONFIG_CTDPumpStopPressure, the CTD is turned off. CTDPumpStopPressure is a firmware threshold and as such, data may continue to be collected for a limited span after the threshold is recognized. Especially in floats that return high resolution discrete data, there might be data collected shallower than the cut off, due to the discrete nature of the pressure data and also due to the time necessary for the firmware to turn off the CTD once the pressure threshold is reached. For example for SOLOII floats the CTD is switched off at 1dbar, and typically the shallowest data is from 0.5 to 0.8 dbar. This shallow data should be carefully assessed for its validity.
