CONFIG_profile_pressure;nominal_profile_depth or pressure_profile_depth;Profile pressure in dbar/10;CONFIG_ProfilePressure_dbar;profile pressure - this may change if the float is reprogrammed and must be reported in the mission configuration settings
CONFIG_parking_pressure;nominal_drift_depth;Parking pressure in dbar/10;CONFIG_ParkPressure_dbar;park pressure - this may change if the float is reprogrammed and must be reported in the mission configuration settings
CONFIG_parking_sample_interval;parking_sample_time;Interval for parking measurements in minutes.;CONFIG_ParkSamplingPeriod_minutes;specifies sampling period during the park phase, e.g. for APEX floats could be hourly or for ARVOR floats 12 hourly, for SOLO/SOLOII floats this definition is: P,T,S is sampled during drift (park) every CONFIG_ParkSamplingPeriod_hours, e.g. every 2 hours.
CONFIG_mission_cycle_time;cycle_time;Mission cycle time in hours.;CONFIG_CycleTime_hours;For APEX and ARVOR floats this is the total duration of one cycle, usually 240 hours (10 days). For SOLO floats this is the total duration of one cycle, assuming that all float operations reach their full time-out intervals before moving to the next float stage. Typically the actual cycle time will be shorter than this value.
