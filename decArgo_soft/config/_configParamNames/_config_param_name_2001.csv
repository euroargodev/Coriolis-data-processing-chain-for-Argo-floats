PM00;Cycle Period;The duration of one cycle of descent, submerged drift, ascent and transmission. The NOVA Profiling Float waits submerged at the parking depth for as long as necessary to make the cycle the selected duration.;CONFIG_CycleTime_days;For APEX and ARVOR floats this is the total duration of one cycle, usually 240 hours (10 days). For SOLO floats this is the total duration of one cycle, assuming that all float operations reach their full time-out intervals before moving to the next float stage. Typically the actual cycle time will be shorter than this value.
PM01;Number of Cycles;This is the number of cycles of descent, submerged drift, ascent and transmission that NOVA will perform. The mission ends and NOVA enters Life Expiry mode when this number of cycles has been completed. Note: when PARAM 1 = 255 the number of cycles is infinite.;CONFIG_MaxCycles_NUMBER;Applies to PROVOR and ARVOR floats, profiler configuration - Number of cycles before float turns itself off, goes into end of life mode, or into recovery mode
PM02;Ascent Time;GMT hour of the day to begin ascent profiles, according to 24-hour clock.;CONFIG_ClockAscentStart_HH;Preset time to start ascent profile, if units = MINUTES (in minutes past midnight), if units = HH (24 hour clock)
PM03;Ascent Sampling Period;The time interval between successive measurements during ascent.;CONFIG_AscentSamplingPeriod_seconds;Sampling period during the ascending profile (in seconds).
PM04;Descent Sampling Period;The time interval between successive measurements during descent.;CONFIG_DescentToParkPresSamplingTime_seconds;Sampling period during the descent to parking pressure (in seconds).
PM05;Parking Sampling Period;The time interval between successive measurements during NOVA’s stay at the drift depth.;CONFIG_ParkSamplingPeriod_hours;specifies sampling period during the park phase, e.g. for APEX floats could be hourly or for ARVOR floats 12 hourly, for SOLO/SOLOII floats this definition is: P,T,S is sampled during drift (park) every CONFIG_ParkSamplingPeriod_hours, e.g. every 2 hours.
PM06;Parking Depth;The depth at which NOVA drifts after completion of a descent while awaiting the time scheduled for the beginning of the next ascent.;CONFIG_ParkPressure_dbar;park pressure - this may change if the float is reprogrammed and must be reported in the mission configuration settings
PM07;Profile Depth;Depth to begin an ascending profile. If NOVA is drifting at some shallower depth, it will first descend to the profile depth before starting the ascent profile.;CONFIG_ProfilePressure_dbar;profile pressure - this may change if the float is reprogrammed and must be reported in the mission configuration settings
PM08;Duration from Parking to Profile Depth;The number of hours before the Ascent time (PARAM 2) that parking will end.;CONFIG_DescentToProfTimeOut_hours;maximum amount of time allowed for the float to descend to Profile pressure from Park pressure

PM14;Reference Day;Set this to zero (0) to set an immediate profile post deployment, after which the cycle period applies.;CONFIG_FloatReferenceDay_FloatDay;Profiler configuration - Reference day, for PROVOR and ARVOR floats this is: The day number on which the first profile is to be made. The day when the mission starts is zero.

PH02;Max oil transfered during descent;Maximum of oil volume transfered via the valve during descent;CONFIG_OilVolumeMaxPerValveAction_cm^3;This information is used as a threshold for the valve action durations. The valve flow is known for each float and CONFIG_OilVolumeMaxPerValveAction_cm^3 is converted to a maxDurationOfValveAction.  During descent phases the float regularly computes a valve duration to sink to the target depth. In some specific cases the result can be a huge valve action duration and the result must be thresholded by maxDurationOfValveAction.
PH03;Min oil transfered during descent;Minimum of oil volume transfered via the valve during descent;CONFIG_OilVolumeMinPerValveAction_cm^3;This information is used as a threshold for the valve action durations. The valve flow is known for each float and CONFIG_OilVolumeMinPerValveAction_cm^3 is converted to a minDurationOfValveAction.  During descent phases the float regularly computes a valve duration to sink to the target depth. In some specific cases the result can be a brief valve action duration and the result must be thresholded by minDurationOfValveAction.

The descent to park phase starts at the crossing of this second threshold.
PH19;Grounding mode;Grounding mode;CONFIG_GroundingMode_LOGICAL;Action performed by the float when a grounding is detected. 0: the float changes its drift pressure, 1: the float stays on the seabed until the next phase of the cycle.
PH20;Surface grounding criteria;Maximum number of valve activation before grounding detection at surface;CONFIG_MinValveActionForSurfaceGroundingDetection_COUNT;Minimum number of surface valve attempts without change in pressure to set the surface grounding flag.
PH21;Deep grounding criteria;Cumulated oil transfer without moving using the valve before grounding detection during descent;CONFIG_OilVolumeMinForGroundingDetection_cm^3;This information is a threshold used to detect a grounding of the float. If there is no vertical motion after having tranfered CONFIG_OilVolumeMinForGroundingDetection_cm^3 through the valve, the gounded flag is activated and the float acts as configurated by the CONFIG_GroundingMode_LOGICAL parameter.So, yes it is a configuration parameter (and I can easily understand that it can be modified via remote control since some PROVOR floats have experienced erroneous grounding detection (under study but perhaps due to in-situ conditions).
