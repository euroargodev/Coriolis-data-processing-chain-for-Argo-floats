MC00;Total Number of Cycles;Total Number of cycles This is the total number of cycles of descent, submerged drift, ascent and transmission that ARVOR-I will perform. The mission ends and ARVOR-I enters Life Expiry mode when this number of cycles has been completed. The capacity of ARVOR-I 's batteries is sufficient for at least 300 cycles (depending on Battery type and volume of CTD data to be acquired and transmitted). If you wish to recover ARVOR-I at the end of the mission, you must set the number of cycles at less than 300 to ensure there is sufficient battery capacity remaining to allow ARVOR-I to return to the sea surface and enter Life Expiry. Under favourable conditions, the battery capacity may exceed 300 cycles. If you do not plan to recover the ARVOR-I float, you may choose to set the number of cycles to 300 to ensure that ARVOR-I completes the maximum number of cycles possible.;CONFIG_MaxCycles_NUMBER;Applies to PROVOR and ARVOR floats, profiler configuration - Number of cycles before float turns itself off, goes into end of life mode, or into recovery mode
MC002;Cycle period;Decoder management of MC2/MC3 configuration parameter;CONFIG_CycleTime_hours;For APEX and ARVOR floats this is the total duration of one cycle, usually 240 hours (10 days). For SOLO floats this is the total duration of one cycle, assuming that all float operations reach their full time-out intervals before moving to the next float stage. Typically the actual cycle time will be shorter than this value.
MC011;Drift depth;Decoder management of MC11/MC13 configuration parameter;CONFIG_ParkPressure_dbar;park pressure - this may change if the float is reprogrammed and must be reported in the mission configuration settings
MC012;Profile depth;Decoder management of MC12/MC14 configuration parameter;CONFIG_ProfilePressure_dbar;profile pressure - this may change if the float is reprogrammed and must be reported in the mission configuration settings
MC04;Reference Day;Reference day (number of days) The float’s internal clock day number is set to zero when the mission starts. When this float day number equals the reference day “MC4”, the float performs its first profile. Thus, as this parameter defines a particular day on which the first profile is to be made, it allows you to configure a group of floats so that they all conduct their first profile at the same time. When setting the reference day, it is recommended to allow enough time between the deployment and reach of profiling depth. Using a reference day of at least 2 will ensure the first profile to be completed.;CONFIG_FloatReferenceDay_FloatDay;Profiler configuration - Reference day, for PROVOR and ARVOR floats this is: The day number on which the first profile is to be made. The day when the mission starts is zero.
MC05;Estimated time at the surface;Expected time at the surface (hours) Expected time float must reach surface.;CONFIG_SurfaceTime_HH;Hour of the float surfacing
MC06;Delay Before Mission;Delay before mission (minutes) To prevent ARVOR-I from trying to sink while still on deck, the float waits for this time before commanding the buoyancy engine to start the descent. After disconnection of the PC, followed by removal of the magnet, ARVOR-I will wait for this delay before beginning the descent. The delay is measured after the first start of the pump which confirms the removal of the magnet (see section 2.4.1) and before the start of the descent.;CONFIG_DelayBeforeMissionStart_minutes;Float waiting period before the first cycle of its mission (in minutes).

Input options for Optode (0: none, 1 : continuous, 2 : pulsed).
MC08;Descent Sampling Period;Descent sampling period (seconds) The time interval between successive CTD measurements during descent. If this parameter is set to 0 seconds, no profile will be carried out during the descent phase. Nevertheless, due to the ARGO requirements, the first descent profile of the mission is automatically done even if the parameter was equal to 0. Minimum value is 8 seconds.;CONFIG_DescentToParkPresSamplingTime_seconds;Sampling period during the descent to parking pressure (in seconds).
MC09;Drift Sampling Period;Drift sampling period (hours) The time interval between successive CTD measurements during ARVOR-I 's stay at the drift depth.;CONFIG_ParkSamplingPeriod_hours;specifies sampling period during the park phase, e.g. for APEX floats could be hourly or for ARVOR floats 12 hourly, for SOLO/SOLOII floats this definition is: P,T,S is sampled during drift (park) every CONFIG_ParkSamplingPeriod_hours, e.g. every 2 hours.

MC25;Grouding switch pressure;Grounding switch pressure In case of grounding during descent to parking depth, float will reduce target pressure from MC25 dBars.;CONFIG_GroundingModePresAdjustment_dbar;If in grounding mode 0, the float changes its drift pressure to its programmed one minus this value only if its current pressure is greater than this value.
MC26;Delay at surface if grounding at surface;Delay in case of grounding at surface (minutes);CONFIG_TimeDelaybeforeDescentRetryWhenStuckAtSurface_minutes;"Time delay between each new attempt to descend when the float is stuck at the surface. When the float cannot reach the pressure threshold defined by ""CONFIG_BuoyancyReductionFirstThreshold_dbar"" after a given number of buoyancy actions it waits a period of time specified by ""CONFIG_TimeDelaybeforeDescentRetryWhenStuckAtSurface_minutes"" before starting a new sequence of buoyancy actions."
MC29;“In Air acquisition” cycle periodicity;“In Air acquisition” cycle periodicity Cycle periodicity for “In Air acquisition to be executed. 0 means no “In Air acquisition 1 means “In Air acquisition” every cycle X means “In Air acquisition” one cycle every “x” cycles;CONFIG_InAirMeasurementPeriodicity_NUMBER;"Cycle periodicity of the ""in air measurement"" phase: - 0 means no ""in air acquisition"" - 1 means ""in air acquisition"" every cycle - N means ""in air acquisition"" one cycle every ""N"" cycles"

PX00;Profiling direction;The float can perform descending profiles or ascending profiles or both.;CONFIG_Direction_NUMBER;Ascending = 1, Descending = 2, Ascending and Descending = 3
PX01;Cut-off pressure of the CTD pump;During the ascending profile, the CTD pump is switched off at a prescribed depth.;CONFIG_CTDPumpStopPressure_dbar;The pressure at which the CTD pump is switched off.  As the float ascends, the code looks at the pressure and if <= CONFIG_CTDPumpStopPressure, the CTD is turned off. CTDPumpStopPressure is a firmware threshold and as such, data may continue to be collected for a limited span after the threshold is recognized. Especially in floats that return high resolution discrete data, there might be data collected shallower than the cut off, due to the discrete nature of the pressure data and also due to the time necessary for the firmware to turn off the CTD once the pressure threshold is reached. For example for SOLOII floats the CTD is switched off at 1dbar, and typically the shallowest data is from 0.5 to 0.8 dbar. This shallow data should be carefully assessed for its validity.
PX02;Cut-off pressure of the ascent profile;Pressure to use to separate pumped/unpumped data in the ascent profile;CONFIG_CTDPumpStopPressurePlusThreshold_dbar;The sum of CONFIG_CTDPumpStopPressure_dbar plus a pressure threshold or overlap (Poverlap).

Poverlap = 0.5 dbar for PROVOR floats with software versions >= 5816A00 and ARVOR floats with software versions >=5605A00.
TC00;Durée maxi d'activation ev en surface (utilisée pour P < palier1);TBD;CONFIG_SurfaceValveMaxTimeAdditionalActions_csec;Maximum duration of the additional valve actions performed at the surface during the buoyancy reduction phase (in centi-seconds).
TC01;Volume transféré par l'ev maxi autorisé en profondeur;TBD;CONFIG_OilVolumeMaxPerValveAction_cm^3;This information is used as a threshold for the valve action durations. The valve flow is known for each float and CONFIG_OilVolumeMaxPerValveAction_cm^3 is converted to a maxDurationOfValveAction.  During descent phases the float regularly computes a valve duration to sink to the target depth. In some specific cases the result can be a huge valve action duration and the result must be thresholded by maxDurationOfValveAction. So yes, this information is a configuration parameter (and for Remocean float it can be modified via remote controls, but of course by specialist in PROVOR vector configuration).

TC10;Critère d'échouage: volume cumulé;TBD;CONFIG_OilVolumeMinForGroundingDetection_cm^3;This information is a threshold used to detect a grounding of the float. If there is no vertical motion after having tranfered CONFIG_OilVolumeMinForGroundingDetection_cm^3 through the valve, the gounded flag is activated and the float acts as configurated by the CONFIG_GroundingMode_LOGICAL parameter.So, yes it is a configuration parameter (and I can easily understand that it can be modified via remote control since some PROVOR floats have experienced erroneous grounding detection (under study but perhaps due to in-situ conditions).

PX03;Ice detection activity flag;Mandatory configuration parameter for Ice floats.;CONFIG_BitMaskMonthsIceDetectionActive_NUMBER;This parameter indicates for which months the ice detection algorithm is active. The bit mask is input as a 3 digit hexadecimal value in the mission file sent to the float. This parameter in the metadata file however is the decimal number of that hexadecimal value. For example for the Southern Hemisphere the default position is to have the ice detection algorithm active for all months except February. (The hexadecimal value in the mission file is 'FFD' and the number for the configuration parameter in the metafile would be 4093). The northern hemisphere default would be all months active except for August. In this case the hexadecimal value is 'F7F' and the number in the configuration parameter in the metafile would be 3967).
