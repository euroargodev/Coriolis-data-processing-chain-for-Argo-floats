PM01;Cycle period;Total duration of a cycle (descent, submerged drift, ascent and transmission) (in days).;CONFIG_CycleTime_days;For APEX and ARVOR floats this is the total duration of one cycle, usually 240 hours (10 days).

Typically the actual cycle time will be shorter than this value.

PT01;Volume transféré par l'EV maxi autorisé en profondeur (pendant les descentes et les repositionnements).;TBD;CONFIG_OilVolumeMaxPerValveAction_cm^3;This information is used as a threshold for the valve action durations. The valve flow is known for each float and CONFIG_OilVolumeMaxPerValveAction_cm^3 is converted to a maxDurationOfValveAction.  During descent phases the float regularly computes a valve duration to sink to the target depth. In some specific cases the result can be a huge valve action duration and the result must be thresholded by maxDurationOfValveAction. So yes, this information is a configuration parameter (and for Remocean float it can be modified via remote controls, but of course by specialist in PROVOR vector configuration).

PT11;Critère d'échouage: volume cumulé (volume minimal transféré sans déplacement avant de déclarer l’échouage).;TBD;CONFIG_OilVolumeMinForGroundingDetection_cm^3;This information is a threshold used to detect a grounding of the float. If there is no vertical motion after having tranfered CONFIG_OilVolumeMinForGroundingDetection_cm^3 through the valve, the gounded flag is activated and the float acts as configurated by the CONFIG_GroundingMode_LOGICAL parameter.So, yes it is a configuration parameter (and I can easily understand that it can be modified via remote control since some PROVOR floats have experienced erroneous grounding detection (under study but perhaps due to in-situ conditions).

PX00;Profiling direction;The float can perform descending profiles or ascending profiles or both.;CONFIG_Direction_NUMBER;Ascending = 1, Descending = 2, Ascending and Descending = 3
PX01;Cut-off pressure of the CTD pump;During the ascending profile, the CTD pump is switched off at a prescribed depth.;CONFIG_CTDPumpStopPressure_dbar;The pressure at which the CTD pump is switched off.  As the float ascends, the code looks at the pressure and if <= CONFIG_CTDPumpStopPressure, the CTD is turned off. CTDPumpStopPressure is a firmware threshold and as such, data may continue to be collected for a limited span after the threshold is recognized. Especially in floats that return high resolution discrete data, there might be data collected shallower than the cut off, due to the discrete nature of the pressure data and also due to the time necessary for the firmware to turn off the CTD once the pressure threshold is reached. For example for SOLOII floats the CTD is switched off at 1dbar, and typically the shallowest data is from 0.5 to 0.8 dbar. This shallow data should be carefully assessed for its validity.

PX04;Optode is mounted on an additional stick;Optode is mounted on an additional stick;CONFIG_OptodeMeasurementsInAir_LOGICAL;Sensors can be mounted on a stick to perform measurements in Air. Values: Yes = 1, No = 0
PX05;Ice detection activity flag;Mandatory configuration parameter for Ice floats.;CONFIG_BitMaskMonthsIceDetectionActive_NUMBER;This parameter indicates for which months the ice detection algorithm is active. The bit mask is input as a 3 digit hexadecimal value in the mission file sent to the float. This parameter in the metadata file however is the decimal number of that hexadecimal value. For example for the Southern Hemisphere the default position is to have the ice detection algorithm active for all months except February. (The hexadecimal value in the mission file is 'FFD' and the number for the configuration parameter in the metafile would be 4093). The northern hemisphere default would be all months active except for August. In this case the hexadecimal value is 'F7F' and the number in the configuration parameter in the metafile would be 3967).
