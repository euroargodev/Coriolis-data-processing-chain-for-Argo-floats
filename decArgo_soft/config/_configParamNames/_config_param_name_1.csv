PM0;Number of cycles;Number of cycles performed by the float before turning itself into the Life Expiry mode (End Of Life mode). Set it to 255 if you don't plan to recover the float and you what it to cycle until exhaustion of its batteries.;CONFIG_MaxCycles_NUMBER;Applies to PROVOR and ARVOR floats, profiler configuration - Number of cycles before float turns itself off, goes into end of life mode, or into recovery mode
PM1;Cycle period;Total duration of a cycle (descent, submerged drift, ascent and transmission) (in days).;CONFIG_CycleTime_days;For APEX and ARVOR floats this is the total duration of one cycle, usually 240 hours (10 days). For SOLO floats this is the total duration of one cycle, assuming that all float operations reach their full time-out intervals before moving to the next float stage. Typically the actual cycle time will be shorter than this value.
PM2;Reference day;Float internal day number when the first ascending profile has to be made (in float day).;CONFIG_FloatReferenceDay_FloatDay;Profiler configuration - Reference day, for PROVOR and ARVOR floats this is: The day number on which the first profile is to be made. The day when the mission starts is zero.
PM3;Ascent time;Hour in the day to start the ascent profile (HH).;CONFIG_ClockAscentStart_HH;Preset time to start ascent profile, if units = MINUTES (in minutes past midnight), if units = HH (24 hour clock)
PM4;Delay before mission;Delay between the float start up and the beginning of the first descent (in minutes).;CONFIG_DelayBeforeMissionStart_minutes;Float waiting period before the first cycle of its mission (in minutes).
PM5;Descent sampling period;Sampling CTD period during the descent to parking depth. If set to 0, no descending profile is performed (except for the first cycle) (in seconds).;CONFIG_DescentToParkPresSamplingTime_seconds;Sampling period during the descent to parking pressure (in seconds).
PM6;Drift sampling period;Sampling CTD period during the drift phase at parking depth. If set to 0, no measurement is performed during the drift phase at parking depth (in hours).;CONFIG_ParkSamplingPeriod_hours;specifies sampling period during the park phase, e.g. for APEX floats could be hourly or for ARVOR floats 12 hourly, for SOLO/SOLOII floats this definition is: P,T,S is sampled during drift (park) every CONFIG_ParkSamplingPeriod_hours, e.g. every 2 hours.
PM7;Ascent sampling period;Sampling CTD period during the ascent to surface. If set to 0, no ascending profile is performed (in seconds).;CONFIG_AscentSamplingPeriod_seconds;Sampling period during the ascending profile (in seconds).
PM8;Drift depth;Parking pressure (in dbar).;CONFIG_ParkPressure_dbar;park pressure - this may change if the float is reprogrammed and must be reported in the mission configuration settings
PM9;Profile depth;Profile pressure (in dbar).;CONFIG_ProfilePressure_dbar;profile pressure - this may change if the float is reprogrammed and must be reported in the mission configuration settings
PM10;Delay before profile;Maximum time allowed to the float to dive from parking to profile depth (in hours).;CONFIG_DescentToProfTimeOut_hours;maximum amount of time allowed for the float to descend to Profile pressure from Park pressure
PM11;Threshold surface/bottom pressure;Isobar that divides shallow depths from deep depths for the purpose of data reduction (in dbar).;CONFIG_PressureThresholdDataReduction_dbar;The isobar that divides shallow depths from deep depths for the purpose of data reduction (in dbars).

PM13;Thickness of the bottom slices;Thickness of the slices for deeep depths (algorithm of data reduction) (in dbar).;CONFIG_ProfileBottomSlicesThickness_dbar;Thickness of the slices for deep depths (algorithm of data reduction) (in dbars).
PA0;Argos transmission period;Time interval between successive Argos transmissions (in seconds).;CONFIG_TransmissionRepetitionPeriod_seconds;transmission repetition rate, metadata for most floats - may be variable for two-way communication
PA1;Retransmission;Argos messages retransmission. Retransmission rate is calculated according to the number of messages to transmit.;CONFIG_TelemetryRetransmission_COUNT;To transmit N Argos messages, the transmission duration of an Argos PROVOR float is : MAX([N*CONFIG_TransmissionRepetitionPeriod_seconds*CONFIG_TelemetryRetransmission_COUNT]/3600, CONFIG_TransmissionMaxTime_hours). So I will use CONFIG_TelemetryRetransmission_COUNT 
PA2;Argos transmission duration;The time that PROVOR will remain on the surface transmitting its data at the end of each cycle. At lower latitudes you may wish to increase the value of this parameter to increase the probability of reception of all of your data (in hours).;CONFIG_TransmissionMinTime_hours;The time the float will remain on the surface transmitting its data at the end of each cycle. At lower latitudes you may wish to increase the value of this parameter to increase the probability of reception of all of your data.
PX0;Profiling direction;The float can perform descending profiles or ascending profiles or both.;CONFIG_Direction_NUMBER;Ascending = 1, Descending = 2, Ascending and Descending = 3
PX1;Cut-off pressure of the CTD pump;During the ascending profile, the CTD pump is switched off at a prescribed depth.;CONFIG_CTDPumpStopPressure_dbar;The pressure at which the CTD pump is switched off.  As the float ascends, the code looks at the pressure and if <= CONFIG_CTDPumpStopPressure, the CTD is turned off. CTDPumpStopPressure is a firmware threshold and as such, data may continue to be collected for a limited span after the threshold is recognized. Especially in floats that return high resolution discrete data, there might be data collected shallower than the cut off, due to the discrete nature of the pressure data and also due to the time necessary for the firmware to turn off the CTD once the pressure threshold is reached. For example for SOLOII floats the CTD is switched off at 1dbar, and typically the shallowest data is from 0.5 to 0.8 dbar. This shallow data should be carefully assessed for its validity.
PX2;Cut-off pressure of the ascent profile;Pressure to use to separate pumped/unpumped data in the ascent profile;CONFIG_CTDPumpStopPressurePlusThreshold_dbar;The sum of CONFIG_CTDPumpStopPressure_dbar plus a pressure threshold or overlap (Poverlap). For PROVOR floats, Poverlap is defined as follows:  Poverlap = bin_size/2 for PROVOR floats with software versions < 5816A00 and ARVOR floats with software versions < 5605A00. Poverlap = 0.5 dbar for PROVOR floats with software versions >= 5816A00 and ARVOR floats with software versions >=5605A00.
PT3;duree d'ouverture maximale de l'électrovanne en surface;TBD;CONFIG_SurfaceValveMaxTimeAdditionalActions_csec;Maximum duration of the additional valve actions performed at the surface during the buoyancy reduction phase (in centi-seconds).
PT4;volume maxi transféré par l'electrovanne en profondeur;TBD;CONFIG_OilVolumeMaxPerValveAction_cm^3;This information is used as a threshold for the valve action durations. The valve flow is known for each float and CONFIG_OilVolumeMaxPerValveAction_cm^3 is converted to a maxDurationOfValveAction.  During descent phases the float regularly computes a valve duration to sink to the target depth. In some specific cases the result can be a huge valve action duration and the result must be thresholded by maxDurationOfValveAction. So yes, this information is a configuration parameter (and for Remocean float it can be modified via remote controls, but of course by specialist in PROVOR vector configuration).
PT5;durée maxi d'activation pompe en profondeur;TBD;CONFIG_PumpActionMaxTimeReposition_csec;Maximum duration of the pump action for a drift readjustment (in centi-seconds).
PT6;volume imposé transféré par l'electrovanne en profondeur;TBD;CONFIG_OilVolumeMinPerValveAction_cm^3;This information is used as a threshold for the valve action durations. The valve flow is known for each float and CONFIG_OilVolumeMinPerValveAction_cm^3 is converted to a minDurationOfValveAction.  During descent phases the float regularly computes a valve duration to sink to the target depth. In some specific cases the result can be a brief valve action duration and the result must be thresholded by minDurationOfValveAction.

PT12;périodicité de mesures en surface;TBD;CONFIG_PressureCheckTimeBuoyancyReductionPhase_seconds;Time delay after each valve action before checking the pressure during the buoyancy reduction phase (in seconds).
PT14;tolérance sur l'atteinte de la pression de consigne (+/-);TBD;CONFIG_PressureTargetToleranceForStabilisation_dbar;Defines the target pressure interval for float stabilisation at parking or profile depth (in dbars).
PT16;pression maxi à ne pas dépasser;TBD;CONFIG_PressureMaxBeforeEmergencyAscent_dbar;Emergency ascent phase start pressure (in dbars).
PT17;pression de début de réduction de la durée d'activation ev en surface;TBD;CONFIG_BuoyancyReductionFirstThreshold_dbar;First threshold of the buoyancy reduction phase (in dbars). From the surface to this first threshold, the float performs one initial valve action (of a computed duration) and N1 additional valve actions (of fixed durations) until the crossing of this first threshold.
PT18;critère de pression de début de plongée;TBD;CONFIG_BuoyancyReductionSecondThreshold_dbar;Second threshold of the buoyancy reduction phase (in dbars). From the first threshold to this second threshold, the float performs N2 additional valve actions (of computed durations) until the crossing of this second threshold. The descent to park phase starts at the crossing of this second threshold.
PT20;nombre de positions hors tolérance autorisé en dérive conduisant à repositionnement;TBD;CONFIG_NumberOfOutOfTolerancePresBeforeReposition_COUNT;Number of consecutive pressure measurements outside the target pressure interval before performing a drift readjustment.
PT21;mode de gestion de l'échouage en descente à la pression de dérive (0 = décalage, 1 = attente);TBD;CONFIG_GroundingMode_LOGICAL;Action performed by the float when a grounding is detected. 0: the float changes its drift pressure, 1: the float stays on the seabed until the next phase of the cycle.
PT23;critère d'échouage: volume cumulé;TBD;CONFIG_OilVolumeMinForGroundingDetection_cm^3;This information is a threshold used to detect a grounding of the float. If there is no vertical motion after having tranfered CONFIG_OilVolumeMinForGroundingDetection_cm^3 through the valve, the gounded flag is activated and the float acts as configurated by the CONFIG_GroundingMode_LOGICAL parameter.So, yes it is a configuration parameter (and I can easily understand that it can be modified via remote control since some PROVOR floats have experienced erroneous grounding detection (under study but perhaps due to in-situ conditions).
PT24;pression en dessous de laquelle le flotteur reste posé en attente profil remontée;TBD;CONFIG_GroundingModeMinPresThreshold_dbar;If in grounding mode 0, the float changes its drift pressure only if its current pressure is greater than this value.
PT25;diminution de la pression visée en cas d'échouage(Pcourante - decal);TBD;CONFIG_GroundingModePresAdjustment_dbar;If in grounding mode 0, the float changes its drift pressure to its programmed one minus this value only if its current pressure is greater than this value.
