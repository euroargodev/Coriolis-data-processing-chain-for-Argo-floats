Typically the actual cycle time will be shorter than this value.

147;CONFIG;Detection threshold for grounding during descent (cm3);CONFIG_OilVolumeMinForGroundingDetection_cm^3;This information is a threshold used to detect a grounding of the float. If there is no vertical motion after having tranferred CONFIG_OilVolumeMinForGroundingDetection_cm^3 through the valve, the gounded flag is activated and the float acts as configurated by the CONFIG_GroundingMode_LOGICAL parameter.So, yes it is a configuration parameter (and I can easily understand that it can be modified via remote control since some PROVOR floats have experienced erroneous grounding detection (under study but perhaps due to in-situ conditions).
148;CONFIG_AUX;Detection threshold for snagging during ascent (cm3);CONFIG_AUX_OilVolumeMinForHangingDetection_cm^3;This information is a threshold used to detect a hanging of the float.

160;CONFIG;Detection management method for snagging during ascent;CONFIG_HangingMode_NUMBER;Action performed by the float when a hanging is detected (see float manual for details). [JP additional comments on behaviour for PROVOR floats: The hanging mode is the same idea as the grounding mode but for an ascent phase. When the float detects a too low vertical motion after having activated its pump to try to ascend it enters in a hanging mode (it is probably stuck at the sea floor). This parameter configures (with the same idea as CONFIG_GroundingMode_NUMBER for grounding) what should be the actions to perform to try to escape from hanging (it can activate its pump and valve alternatively to try to escape or abandon the ascent and switch to the next scheduled task].

As the float ascends, the code looks at the pressure and if <= CONFIG_CTDPumpStopPressure, the CTD is turned off. CTDPumpStopPressure is a firmware threshold and as such, data may continue to be collected for a limited span after the threshold is recognized. Especially in floats that return high resolution discrete data, there might be data collected shallower than the cut off, due to the discrete nature of the pressure data and also due to the time necessary for the firmware to turn off the CTD once the pressure threshold is reached.
