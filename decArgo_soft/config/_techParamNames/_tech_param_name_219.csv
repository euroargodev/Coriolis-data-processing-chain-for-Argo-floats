100;2;Cycle start time;CLOCK_InitialValveActionDescentToPark_HHMM;Day number of the beginning of buoyancy reduction (relative to mission start day).
101;3;Descent start time;CLOCK_StartDescentProfile_HHMM;time when descent profile starts
102;4;End of descent time;CLOCK_EndDescentToPark_HHMM;time when park pressure is reached  (tenths of an hour since midnight)
103;5;Ascent start time;CLOCK_StartAscentToSurface_HHMM;Number of minutes elapsed in the day at the beginning of the ascent to the surface.
104;6;Time at end of ascent;CLOCK_EndAscentToSurface_HHMM;ascent end time, just before Argos transmission  - note units can vary and the raw values can be in the tech file only if it's not possible to calculate the final JULD in real time.
105;7;Transmission start time;CLOCK_TransmissionStart_HHMM;time of the first transmission for this cycle
106;11;Number of valve actions in descent;NUMBER_ValveActionsDuringDescentToPark_COUNT;number of valve actions between the crossing  of the gap threshold and the end of descent at park pressure
107;12;Number of pump actions in descent;NUMBER_PumpActionsDuringDescentToPark_COUNT;number of pump actions between the crossing  of the gap threshold and the end of descent at park pressure
108;13;Number of re-grounding in drift;FLAG_Grounded_NUMBER;grounded flag , diagnostic bit - could also be logical?  Yes/no? 0/1? Or can be number of profiles during which the float grounded
109;15;Pressure sensor offset (two’s complement coded);PRES_SurfaceOffsetCorrectedNotReset_1dbarResolution_dbar;Surface pressure recorded just before the previous descent but data is corrected on board the float. Note: cumulative offset but no further correction required. Autocorrected
110;16;Internal pressure;PRESSURE_InternalVacuumAtSurface_mbar;Surface internal pressure
111;17;Batteries voltage drop at Pmax, pump ON (with regard to Unom = 10.0 V) (in dV) ;VOLTAGE_BatteryPumpStartProfile_volts;Pump battery voltage (volts) at depth
112;18;Internal temperature;TEMPERATURE_InternalVacuumAtSurface_degC;internal tube temperature at the surface
113;19;Descent speed;TECH_AUX_SPEED_DescentToPark_cm/s;Average vertical speed during the descent to parking depth
114;20;Ascent speed;TECH_AUX_SPEED_AscentToSurface_cm/s;Average vertical speed during the ascent to surface
115;21;Number of ascent CTD messages;NUMBER_AscentIridiumPackets_COUNT;Number of Iridium packets used to transmit sensor data collected during the ascent from the profile depth to the surface.
116;30;RTC state indicator ( normal = 0, failure = 1);FLAG_RTCStatus_LOGICAL;real time clock status - 1= OK, 0=not OK
117;31;Defect mode;TECH_AUX_FLAG_CycleStatus_NUMBER;Flag indicating the status of the cycle (0: nominal, 1: grounding at surface, 2: grounding at pressure shallower than min pressure, 3: max pressure reached during descent, 4: max pressure reached during drift, 5: low battery (less than 6.6V), 6: number of programmed cycle is reached, 10: no programmed date for surfacing after present date, 11: message at deployment, 12 : Mission start again after wait at surface).
1000;-1;Number of ascent CTD packets received;TECH_AUX_NUMBER_AscentIridiumPacketsReceived_COUNT;Number of Iridium packets received to transmit sensor data collected during the ascent from the profile depth to the surface.
